/*
 * bag.h - header file for CS50 'bag' module
 *
 * A ‘bag’ is a collection of indistinguishable items; it starts empty,
 * grows as the caller adds one item at a time, and shrinks as the caller
 * extracts one item at a time. It could be empty, or could contain hundreds
 * of items. Since items are indistinguishable, the module is free to return
 * any item from the bag.
